# /data directory

The data from the 2022 sensorium competition can be downloaded here [https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022](https://gin.g-node.org/cajal/Sensorium2022). Move it into the "sensorium_data2022" directory. 

**Note:** Downloading the files all at once as a directory does lead to unfortunate errors. Thus, all datastes have to be downloadede individually.

You do not need to unpack the .zip-files!
